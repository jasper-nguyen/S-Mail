	As creators of the S-mail email service, it is our responsibility in providing a secure, confidential, and efficient means of communication for the public. Firstly, S-mail saves our user’s login information inside a database which allows a consumer to enter their email and password to allow access to a registered account. We are accountable for any incidents where the database is compromised, which is why we have implemented hash programming via werkzeug.security, so that any hackers who attempt to access the database only see the hash version of the user’s information. Secondly, take responsibility in ensuring that the messages sent between users are kept private. By maintaining confidentiality, we are protecting our consumers’ right to privacy, giving them some peace of mind. 
	Thanks to the introduction of electronic instant messaging, programmers have effectively shifted the economic, environmental, global, and societal contexts of communication. With electronic mail, we’ve changed the negative effects communication has played on the environment. Instead of sending mail via letter, where it would be transported digitally which helps reduce the amount of carbon emissions cars and places emit when delivering letters to your doorstep. People all over the world now have the means to communicate with loved ones and business partners from the otherside of the globe in an instant. This has destroyed the trend of penpals and the anticipation of awaiting a letter from someone. On an economic level, significantly less people buy stamps nowadays, and communication has become more cost effective, and less time consuming compared to sending letters where the consumer needs to spend on stamps, and paper. Finally, society now carries a less hefty burden when they need to contact someone thousands of miles away, where you can stay in touch with just the click of a button. Furthermore, society has evolved to utilize casual language in their communication due to letters incentivizing more thought since the process of getting that letter delivered is a lengthy process.
